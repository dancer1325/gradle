- allows
    - := build / if inputs of the previous build have NOT changed → 👁️skip running tasks 👁️
        - requirements
            - tasks must define
                - inputs
                - outputs

- ways to display task state
    - `… --console=verbose`
    - `org.gradle.console=verbose` in ‘gradle.properties’

- incremental build
    - by default, they are enabled
    - ⚠️if you switch to other branches → it does NOT recognize it → use build caching⚠️
    - `UP-TO-DATE`
        - task state /  skiped to run by incremental build

- build caching
    - how does it work?
        - store previous built results
          - **Note:** 👁️If the files are NOT used from a long time → Gradle removes it👁️
    - uses
        - share across teams
        - speed up builds
            - local
            - CI
    - `FROM-CACHE`
        - task state /  skiped to run by build caching
    - types of cache
        - local
          - **Note:** 👁️if there are both caches → local is firstly checked👁️
        - remote
            - ways
