- allows
    - if file inputs change → automatically 👁️ after passing quiet period 👁️ re-execute the requested tasks
        - quiet period
            - := period without detecting changes
            - `org.gradle.continuous.quietperiod`
- `… -t` / `--continuous`
- how does it work?
    - via File System Watching  -- Check '../optimizingBuildPerformance/fileSystemWatching' --
- ways to terminate it
    - if Gradle is attached to an interactive input source → `CTRL-D`
    - if Gradle is NOT attached to an interactive input source (*Example:* part of a script) → `kill`
    - if it’s executed via Tooling API → use Tooling API ‘s cancellation mechanism
- cases in which changes are NOT detected
    - input directory previously missing
    - files outside of project directories
    - untracked tasks
    - build cycles
