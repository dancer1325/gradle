[[continuous_builds]]
= Continuous Builds

* := build mode
* allows
    ** if file inputs change → automatically re-execute the requested (& dependent) tasks | 👁️after passing quiet period / NO more changes 👁️
        *** if you want to add build logic changes -> continuous build must be restarted manually
        *** quiet period
            **** := period (in ms) without detecting changes
            **** `<<build_environment.adoc#sec:gradle_configuration_properties,org.gradle.continuous.quietperiod>>`
* `… -t` / `--continuous`
* _Example:_

    gradle test --continuous   // test and ALL dependent tasks are run continuously

* how does it work?
    ** -- via -- <<file_system_watching.adoc#sec:daemon_watch_fs,file system watching>>
        *** == detect changes | inputs
* root causes / continuous builds do NOT work
    ** file system watching does NOT work | your system
    ** if you use `--no-daemon`

== Terminating Continuous Build

* ways to terminate Continuous Build
    ** if Gradle -- is attached to an -- interactive input source (_Example:_ terminal)  → `CTRL-D`
    ** if Gradle is NOT attached to an interactive input source (_Example:_ part of a script) → `kill`
    ** if it’s executed via Tooling API → use Tooling API ‘s cancellation mechanism

[[continuous_build_limitations]]
== Limitations

* cases / inputs changes are NOT detected

[[sec:continuous_build_missing_files]]
=== Creating input directories

* input directory / previously missing
* _Example1:_ create the `src/main/java` (-> PREVIOUSLY, it was missing)
* _Example2:_ if the input is a <<working_with_files.adoc#filtering_files,filtered file tree>> & NO files match the filter

[[sec:continuous_build_untracked]]
=== Inputs of untracked tasks

* <<incremental_build.adoc#sec:disable-state-tracking,untracked tasks>> OR tasks / NO outputs

[[sec:continuous_build_project_dir]]
=== Changes to files outside of project directories

* files outside the project directory

[[sec:build_cycles]]
=== Build cycles

* if task modifies its own inputs | executing
    ** -> Gradle will
        *** detect the change
        *** trigger a new build
    ** | NO Continuous Build (== default mode) -> will NEVER be considered "UP-TO-DATE"
    ** if you want to track down the task -> you need to identify the reported changed files / inputs change
        *** ".java" -- is compiled with -- `compileJava`
        *** `--info`
